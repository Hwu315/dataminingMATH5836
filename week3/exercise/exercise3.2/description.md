## Exercise 3.2

Neural networks for regression problems: 

* Use the dataset from exercise 1.4 and run the same experiments using neural networks and compare with linear regression for the heating load.  

* Extend the model in Part 1 so that it can predict both the heating and cooling load. Therefore, you need to have 2 output neurons with linear outputs. 

* Apply neural networks for the Abalone dataset given in Assesment 1 and compare with linear regression results. 

* Ensure that you do 30 experiments in all the above tasks. In each experiment, you can have a different train/test split.
