##Exercise 3.1

### Python Challenge  

* Try training the FNN model with two selected classification datasets from the UCI machine learning repository. Evaluate the effect of number of hidden neurons, and learning rate [0.1, 0.2 ...1]. Try 10 experiments with different random state in data split (60/40 train/test) or different initial weights for each run and report the mean and standard deviation for each experiment and plot your results. 

* Optional (this will require more time and not part of the course assessment)

* Try to add another hidden later and update the forward and backward pass. 

* Can you generalise to any user-selected number of hidden layers? Discuss how you will do this and implement it if possible. 

### R Challenge

* Use either Caret or Keras in R. Try training the FNN model with two selected classification datasets from the UCI machine learning repository. Evaluate the effect of the number of hidden neurons, and learning rate [0.1, 0.2 ...1]. Try 10 experiments with different initial positions in weight space for each case and report mean and standard deviation for each experiment and plot your results.
