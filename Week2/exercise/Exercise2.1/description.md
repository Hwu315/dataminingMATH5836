## Exercise 2.1 Logistic Regression 

Develop a logistic regression model for binary classification in R or Python and do the following: 

* Create 60/40 train test spilt and report training and test performance in terms  classification performance 

* Report AUC and ROC and Precision-Recall curve, F1 Score. 

* Try L1/L2 and elastic net regularisation and compare results. 

* Carry out 10 independent experiment runs for each case and report the mean and std of the results in Part 2.

* Carry out 10-fold cross-validation on the original dataset and report the results required in Part 2.  

You can use Caret with R or any other library. You can use scikit-learn with Python or the code from scratch.
